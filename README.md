# Cryptocurrency Market Analysis
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets used for a project on cryptocurrency market analysis.  

## Project Overview  
The project focuses on using machine learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market performance. We use the K-Means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and trends in cryptocurrency market data.

## Data  
The data used in this project is stored in the Resources folder. The main dataset is crypto_market_data.csv, which includes information about various cryptocurrencies such as price changes over different periods.  

## Code  
The code for the project is contained in the Jupyter notebook Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb. This notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, clustering using K-Means, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and visualization of results.  

## Libraries Used  
The project uses the following Python libraries:  

pandas: for data manipulation and analysis  
hvplot: for creating interactive plots  
sklearn: for machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing  

## How to Run  
To run the notebook, you need to have Jupyter notebook installed, as well as the libraries mentioned above. Once these are installed, you can clone the repository and run the notebook using Jupyter.
